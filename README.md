# vit-cnn-image-classification

This student project (serving as a semster project from University of Toronto's UTIAS module AER 1515 â€“ Perception for Robotics) aims to asses the robustness between pre-trained classical _Convolutional Neural Network_ (CNN) and state-of-the-art _Visual Transformers_ (ViT) models for a multi-class image classification task of road signs in a detailed, comparative analysis under varying image qualities.

By fine-tuning and comparing both DNNs using `PyTorch`, the project aims to provide insights into their classification task performance and _out-of-the-box_ robustness in realistic driving scenarios with different weather conditions.
